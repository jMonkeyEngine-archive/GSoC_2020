### Cinematic Editor
JME3 engine has a built in cinematic system. For now, all can be controlled by code, but it can become quite complicated for complex cut scenes with many cameras and models to interact.
Making a cinematic editor in JME sdk, would ease up the process of making cutscenes, and offer a much more wysiwyg experience to our users.

The cinematic editor would look like a compositor with a timeline and optionally several tracks.
One would create and place cinematic events on the timeline and could see the result in real time.
Several animation systems are available in JME3, Bone animation, Spatial animation and they can be combined with sound tracks and effect tracks (based on particle emitters). The cinematic editor should be should act as a conductor for all these animations.

Features needed :
- interactive editing of cinematics with cinematic events creation, and drag and drop over a timeline.
- saving cinematics in a binary file (same as J3o, but only for cinematics). This should already work, all cinematics classes implements the Savable interface.
- Being able to bake the cinematic in a video format, and be able to play it back at runtime (this can be tied to a new project : video playback in JME3)

### Bindings for Recast navigation
Recast is state of the art navigation mesh construction toolset for games. We’d like to have bindings created for it, similar to how we’ve incorporated the native Bullet physics library into jME3.

### Integrate with SmartBody
SmartBody is an advanced animation system for humanoid characters. We could integrate it with Blender/jME3

### ChromiumEmbedded
“The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) is a simple framework for embedding Chromium-based browsers in other applications.” There are many uses for an embedded browser inside of a game, such as news updates and store frontends (see Valve’s DOTA2 for instance).

### Agent System, AI
Generic agent system for all game actors, with flexible and reusable AI component system, that will be base for adding different implementations of AI algorithms. This should decouple AI and game logic from drawing and other JME systems. Include implementations of typical game tasks like weapon selection, path finding, etc. Use some existing game for prototyping. This system should allow creation of the tools for simply adding AI algorithms to game characters by simply drag n’ dropping from the palette. In addition this will turn jME into a simulation virtual environment, which can be used as a testbed for various AI algorithms.

Requirements: JME, agent systems, game AI

### Steer AI port
Steer is an open source C++ library for steering behaviors. It provides game characters the ability to navigate around their world in a life-like and improvisational manner. These “steering behaviors” are largely independent of the particulars of the character’s means of locomotion. Combinations of steering behaviors can be used to achieve higher level goals (For example: get from here to there while avoiding obstacles, follow this corridor, join that group of characters…).

The library is no longer actively developed, so there will not be new features to backport, and the Java library could be developed further.

### Realistic wave behaviour
Advanced ocean simulation with a realistic wave behaviour and a proper collision detection to allow “swimming”.
The basic simulation should be independent from the jME so that other graphic engines can use it as well.
Would allow awesome ship battles like in Assassins Creed 4.
Only above surface simulation (so no underwater effects. The current goal is complicated enough)
existing prototype with oceanmonkey (http://sourceforge.net/projects/oceanmonkey/) based on the theoretical work from tessendorf (see link below) and keith lantz (wrote a c++-implementation)

Requirements:
- very good understanding in math
- good understanding of complex algorithms

### Getdown SDK integration
“GetDown aims to provide a system for downloading and installing a collection of files on a user’s machine and upgrading those files as needed. Though just any collection of files would do, Getdown is mainly intended for the distribution and maintenance of the collection of files that make up a Java application.”

An SDK integration with Getdown should make it super easy to distribute updates for PC games.

### BVH Animation
Add animation retargeting for humanoid animations (e.g. BHV) to the animation system. At the same time the animation system should be extended to support easier sharing of animations. Retargeting involves changing the animation so that a different skeleton from another model can play back the animation without distorting.

### Plugin Repository
We’d like to establish a proper plugin repository based on GitHub. This would be a place for developers to find proper SDK plugins as well as stand-alone libraries and snippets. Every project should be hosted in its own self-contained repository.

Requirements:
- Experienced with web development
- Familiar with Git and GitHub API
- No Java or jME3 experience required!

http://www.jekyll-plugins.com/ – Covers practically all of our design goals. This is pretty much what we want.

### Extend ScriptMonkey – Groovy
ScriptMonkey is a Groovy shell window that can be used to control a jME scene. So the app starts up with a standard jME window with a few boxes in it, some default lights, etc… but it also opens up a separate Groovy Console window.

Planned improvements:
- Saving scenes/models. That’s the big one… no point in tweaking stuff if you can save it out again for later.
- HUD-related scripting. Add the ability to hook scripts on buttons in the hud and mouse events, etc… with another set of buttons to switch modes.

### FBX Pipeline
Create a means for FBX models to be imported into jMonkeyEngine.

Approach #1: Modify converter tool

https://github.com/libgdx/fbx-conv

https://github.com/projectanarchy/fbximporter

Approach #2: Write an importer for the FBX format.

# GSoC 2014 Announcement (News)
Google granted us 3 student slots for GSoC, which is a big win considering that’s more than most new organisations get! Furthermore, due to the high number of impressive applicants and a very successful [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jmonkeyengine-summer-of-code#/) campaign for our self-hosted jMESoC, we’ve decided to take on an additional 4 students for our own community-sponsored Summer of Code projects. (next year we’ll probably call them Summer Bounties or smt to lessen the confusion).

In total, 7 students will be working on a funded project this summer.

### Differences between GSoC and jMESoC
In terms of raw ability we expect the same quality of work from all participants. The key difference between GSoC and jMESoC is scope.

GSoC students are expected to work on their project like it’s a full time job.

jMESoC students on the other hand can get by with a smaller time commitment, as long as their milestones and end-goal are still met. They will also not have dedicated mentors they can 100% rely upon, but they will have unofficial mentors to back them up none the less.

### GSoC Projects
#### Cinematic Editor
A continuation of our existing cinematics system. This project will add a complete cinematic editor interface to our SDK, in the form of a plugin.

The project is being headed up by Mayank @mayank who will be mentored by Rémy @nehon.

#### Recast Navigation
Our current navmesh system is based on an old Java port of Recast Navigation. Now, much like with Bullet physics, we’re gonna create a wrapper for the native Recast Navigation, keeping jME3 forever on par with its latest features.

The project is being headed up by Tihomir @tihomir who will be mentored by Brent @sploreg.

#### Voxel Terrain
The voxel terrain project, using dual marching cubes, will allow ambitious voxel game developers to quickly prototype their big ideas with live editing tools and physics integration.

The project is being headed up by John @FuzzyMonkey who will be mentored by Tim @zarch

### jMESoC Projects
#### Nifty Editor
Many developers (not to mention artists!) would prefer not having to deal with GUI programming at all, and that’s why this project is attempting to build a user friendly editor in top of NiftyGUI, available as an SDK plugin of course.

The project is being headed up by Cristiano @relucri, unofficially mentored by @void256

#### Realistic Waves
There are few things more satisfying in 3D graphics than good looking waves. To achieve even more realistic waves, features such as buoyancy will be added.

The project is being headed up by Thilina @thilina, unofficially mentored by Sascha @ceiphren

#### Mobile Demos
We are in dire need of some better mobile demos, and we are getting them! This project will create mobile-centric demo applications to better showcase jME3′s features for mobile device development.

The project is being headed up by Kasun @dinal24, unofficially mentored by Eric @iwgeric

#### Steering Port
With more AI features quickly coming to jME3, the time is right to port a classic old steering library, and improve upon it further as a new project.

The project is being headed up by Jésus @jesusmb1995, unofficially mentored by @sevarac (who will also be co-mentoring the Recast project).
