 - pass shadows. That Kiril’s PR has been in “almost finished” state since like forever and programmable shadows are a very useful thing when writing shaders

### Integrate with SmartBody
SmartBody is an advanced animation system for humanoid characters. We could integrate it with Blender/jME3

### ChromiumEmbedded
“The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) is a simple framework for embedding Chromium-based browsers in other applications.” There are many uses for an embedded browser inside of a game, such as news updates and store frontends (see Valve’s DOTA2 for instance).

### Agent System, AI
Generic agent system for all game actors, with flexible and reusable AI component system, that will be base for adding different implementations of AI algorithms. This should decouple AI and game logic from drawing and other JME systems. Include implementations of typical game tasks like weapon selection, path finding, etc. Use some existing game for prototyping. This system should allow creation of the tools for simply adding AI algorithms to game characters by simply drag n’ dropping from the palette. In addition this will turn jME into a simulation virtual environment, which can be used as a testbed for various AI algorithms.

Requirements: JME, agent systems, game AI

### Bindings for Recast navigation
Recast is state of the art navigation mesh construction toolset for games. We’d like to have bindings created for it, similar to how we’ve incorporated the native Bullet physics library into jME3.

### Steer AI port
Steer is an open source C++ library for steering behaviors. It provides game characters the ability to navigate around their world in a life-like and improvisational manner. These “steering behaviors” are largely independent of the particulars of the character’s means of locomotion. Combinations of steering behaviors can be used to achieve higher level goals (For example: get from here to there while avoiding obstacles, follow this corridor, join that group of characters…).

The library is no longer actively developed, so there will not be new features to backport, and the Java library could be developed further.

### Realistic wave behaviour
Advanced ocean simulation with a realistic wave behaviour and a proper collision detection to allow “swimming”.
The basic simulation should be independent from the jME so that other graphic engines can use it as well.
Would allow awesome ship battles like in Assassins Creed 4.
Only above surface simulation (so no underwater effects. The current goal is complicated enough)
existing prototype with oceanmonkey (http://sourceforge.net/projects/oceanmonkey/) based on the theoretical work from tessendorf (see link below) and keith lantz (wrote a c++-implementation)

Requirements:
- very good understanding in math
- good understanding of complex algorithms

### Getdown SDK integration
“GetDown aims to provide a system for downloading and installing a collection of files on a user’s machine and upgrading those files as needed. Though just any collection of files would do, Getdown is mainly intended for the distribution and maintenance of the collection of files that make up a Java application.”

An SDK integration with Getdown should make it super easy to distribute updates for PC games.

### BVH Animation
Add animation retargeting for humanoid animations (e.g. BHV) to the animation system. At the same time the animation system should be extended to support easier sharing of animations. Retargeting involves changing the animation so that a different skeleton from another model can play back the animation without distorting.

### Plugin Repository
We’d like to establish a proper plugin repository based on GitHub. This would be a place for developers to find proper SDK plugins as well as stand-alone libraries and snippets. Every project should be hosted in its own self-contained repository.

Requirements:
- Experienced with web development
- Familiar with Git and GitHub API
- No Java or jME3 experience required!

### Extend ScriptMonkey – Groovy
ScriptMonkey is a Groovy shell window that can be used to control a jME scene. So the app starts up with a standard jME window with a few boxes in it, some default lights, etc… but it also opens up a separate Groovy Console window.

Planned improvements:
- Saving scenes/models. That’s the big one… no point in tweaking stuff if you can save it out again for later.
- HUD-related scripting. Add the ability to hook scripts on buttons in the hud and mouse events, etc… with another set of buttons to switch modes.

### FBX Pipeline
Create a means for FBX models to be imported into jMonkeyEngine.

Approach #1: Modify converter tool

https://github.com/libgdx/fbx-conv

https://github.com/projectanarchy/fbximporter

Approach #2: Write an importer for the FBX format.
